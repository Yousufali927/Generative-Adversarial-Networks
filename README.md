# Generative-Adversarial-Networks
This repository contains code for implementations of different types of Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)

1. contains code for a simple mnist GAN, contains a basic generator and a discriminator using two different loss functions and optimizers,
had some error saving the model(the generator and discriminator states) but everything else worked out and ran this for 11 epochs on my macbook air M1, each epoch was taking around 2-3 mins so couldn't run it for longer due to specs and time consumption. after training for only 11 epochs we can still generate relatively nice fake mnist images(considering we trained for just 11 out of the 50 epochs).
